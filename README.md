# OZGovernor

## About

OZGovernor is a comprehensive governance contract developed as an extension of OpenZeppelin by [Tally](https://tally.xyz) developers. This contract incorporates additional functionalities for voting, timelock control, and quorum implementation, providing an efficient governance solution for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

## üìó Overview

This repository contains tasks and scripts for effortless deployment and testing of a OZ Governance and it's DAO smart contracts on Ethereum networks. It also offers a deeper insight into OZGovernor, including its functionalities and a placeholder for deployment instructions. Adjustments or additions can be made based on the specific deployment details once available.

**Features:**

‚úÖ Simple deployment script for the OZ Governor and other contracts

‚úÖ Tasks that are helpers to interact with OZ Governor

‚úÖ Testing complete lifecycle of proposals

###  Contract Overview

The OZGovernor contract integrates various extensions from OpenZeppelin for robust governance features. It facilitates:

- **OZGovernor:** This contract represents the main governance contract that handles voting and execution of proposals using the OpenZeppelin governance framework.
- **GovernorToken:** This contract represents the token used for voting in the governance system. It provides functionality for token holders to cast their votes on proposals.
- **TimelockController:** This contract implements a timelock mechanism for delaying the execution of certain operations. It ensures that proposals go through a waiting period before they can be executed, allowing for a grace period for token holders to review and challenge the proposals.

Want to deploy your DAO with Tally, we also have [premium features](https://docs.tally.xyz/premium-features).

## üßê Using it with Tally

0. Fill `.env` file and install the repo as explained in [instalation](#installation)
1. Remember to fill use the configs for your DAO, you can find it in `deploy.config.ts`
2. Deploy the contracts using the [deploy method](#deploying).
5. Validate your contract as explained [here](#validating-contract).
6. You will also have to mint and share tokens to members of your DAO
7. Remember to remove yourself as minter from the token when finished with task 6
7. Add your DAO to Tally!, [do it here](https://www.tally.xyz/add-a-dao)

## üíª Getting Started

#### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/withtally/gov_deployer.git && cd gov_deployer && git checkout new
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in the necessary values in the .env file (e.g., node RPCs)
# You can also set all the values 
# npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY
```

Some other commands

```bash
pnpm clean
pnpm test
npx hardhat compile
```

It also adds the whole contracts added and their verify lines to a file called `contracts.out`, for future reference so you can close your terminal with no worries.

#### Pre-Requisites

- Node.js and PNPM
- Git

#### Deploying

The configuration parameters to deploy the contracts can be found at `deploy.config` in the root of this folder.

```bash
# you have to define the network according to network name listed in hardhat.config.ts
pnpm deployc --network sepolia
# to test in hardhat just run
pnpm deployc
```

#### Validating Contract
After running the script to deploy the contract, it will print the command lines needed to validate each contract in your terminal. 

But to run those contracts you must have provided your Etherscan ( or other scan ) to the API KEY in the `.env` file, you can use it to validate the contracts.

Example output:

```bash
quorum numerator: 30 
vote extension: 7200
